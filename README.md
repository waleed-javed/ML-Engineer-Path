<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This Repo Contains Jupyter notebooks, Code Files, Practice Assignments for ML Projects.

### Built Via

* [TensorFlow]()
* [Google Collab]()
* [Numpy]()
* [Pandas]()
* [Sk.Learn / Keras]()


# Objectives

1. Explain how neural networks (deep and otherwise) compare to other machine learning models.
2. Determine when a deep neural network would be a good choice for a particular problem.
3. Demonstrate your understanding of the material through a final project uploaded to GitHub.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* Google Collab / Jupyter Notebook
